    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Hi there, I'm Chainalyn F. Galinato, a driven and enthusiastic student of computer engineering who is presently enrolled at St. John Technological College of the Philippines (SJTCP) to complete my degree. The connection of innovation, technology, and problem-solving has always captivated me. My interest in computer engineering was sparked by this attraction, which allowed me to investigate both the software and hardware aspects of technology and create solutions that had an influence on the world.</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h2>I like working with others on projects that entail circuit design, performance optimization, and coding. I work best in practical settings where I can use my academic knowledge to provide useful, workable answers. Additionally, I have a strong interest in disciplines like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and embedded systems, and I am always looking for ways to increase my knowledge in these areas.</h2>
    <hr/>
    <h2>I hope to contribute to the state-of-the-art developments in computer engineering as I complete my education and eventually seek a profession that combines my technical expertise with originality and creativity.</h2>
